        <p>Global warming is a term used for the observed century-scale rise in the
             average temperature of the Earth's climate system and its related effects.
              Scientists are more than 95% certain that nearly all of global warming is 
              caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other 
              human-caused emissions. Within the earth's atmosphere, accumulating greenhouse gases
               like water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the gases 
               within the atmosphere that absorb and emit heat radiation. Increasing or decreasing
                amounts of greenhouse gases
               within the atmosphere act to either hold in or release more of the heat from the sun.</p>

        <p>Fossil fuels – coal, oil, and gas – are by far the largest contributor to global climate change, accounting for over 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
        <p>As greenhouse gas emissions blanket the Earth, they trap the sun’s heat, leading to global warming and climate change. The world is now warming faster than at any point in recorded history. Warmer temperatures are changing weather patterns and disrupting the usual balance of nature, posing many risks to human beings and all other forms of life on Earth.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Global warming is an increase in the Earth's atmospheric and oceanic 
            temperature. This causes imbalances in the environment, leading to various
             challenges for ecosystems and humanity. Addressing greenhouse gas emissions
              is crucial for combating climate change and protecting the environment. 
              International agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, aim to limit global 
              temperature rise and promote sustainable practices. Individual actions, such as 
              reducing energy consumption and supporting renewable energy,
              also play a vital role in mitigating climate change</p>

                <marquee>Say no to global warming: our planet's
                     health is in our hands. Together, we can turn the tide and create
                     a sustainable future for generations to come."</marquee>
